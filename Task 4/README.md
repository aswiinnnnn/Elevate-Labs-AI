# Classification: Logistic Regression (Breast Cancer)

## Objective
Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression classifier to detect malignant vs benign tumors using the provided dataset.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (train_test_split, StandardScaler, LogisticRegression)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
- **File**: `data.csv` (included in `Task 4` directory)
- The notebook drops non-feature columns (`id`, `Unnamed: 32`) and maps the diagnosis labels `M` -> 1 (malignant), `B` -> 0 (benign).

## Analysis Completed (what's implemented in `AIML_T4.ipynb`)

1. Data loading & cleaning
   - Loaded `data.csv` with Pandas.
   - Dropped `id` and `Unnamed: 32` columns.
   - Encoded `diagnosis` to numeric labels (`M`=1, `B`=0).

2. Feature / target split
   - Separated features `X` and target `y` (`diagnosis`).

3. Train / test split
   - Split data into training and test sets using an 80/20 split (`train_test_split(..., test_size=0.2, random_state=42)`).

4. Feature scaling
   - Standardized features with `StandardScaler()` (fit on training set, transform on test set).

5. Model training
   - Trained `LogisticRegression(max_iter=500)` on the scaled training data.

6. Predictions & probabilities
   - Generated class predictions (`predict`) and positive-class probabilities (`predict_proba[:, 1]`) on the test set.

7. Evaluation
   - Computed `accuracy`, `precision`, and `recall` scores.
   - Printed the `classification_report` showing precision, recall, f1-score per class.
   - Created and plotted the confusion matrix using Seaborn heatmap.

## How to Run
1. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Open the notebook `AIML_T4.ipynb` and run cells sequentially. The notebook executes the full pipeline from loading data to model evaluation.

## Notebook Outputs / Variables
- Common variables generated by the notebook: `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`, `model`, `y_pred`, `y_prob`, `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, `cm` (confusion matrix).

## Interview Questions (practice)
- How did you preprocess the data before training? Why is scaling needed for this model?
- Why choose Logistic Regression for this problem? What are its advantages and limitations?
- How do precision and recall differ, and why might one be preferred over the other for medical diagnosis?
- How would you improve model performance (feature selection, regularization, other models)?

## What You'll Learn
- Building a complete ML pipeline: data cleaning, splitting, scaling, training, and evaluation
- Interpreting classification metrics and confusion matrices
- Basic model improvement ideas (hyperparameters, cross-validation, feature engineering)

This README documents the exact steps implemented in `AIML_T4.ipynb` — it does not add new analysis beyond what's present in the notebook.
